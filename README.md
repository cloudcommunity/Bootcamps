# Bootcamps

Here we collect ideas about a potential bootcamp course that we want to create.

## DevOps Engineer Bootcamp

Focused on professionals interested in bridging software development with IT operations. Topics could include continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, automation tools, monitoring, and logging. This role is also known as Site Reliability Engineer (SRE). 

## Cloud Architect Bootcamp

Designed for individuals aiming to design cloud solutions and architectures. This bootcamp would cover cloud service models, designing scalable and secure applications, disaster recovery strategies, and best practices in cloud architecture.
